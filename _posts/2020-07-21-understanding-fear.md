excerpt: Maybe you are late for a deadline, are frustrated someone else did not fulfill what they said they would, or weeks of planning just didn't work out this time. Regardless, we can choose how we will handle our emotions to be a positive force in our daily activities.

At Levity's incubating Alma-mater, students were informed they'd need to complete the remainder of their Spring semester online. In a matter of days Storm Lake's BVU morphed from an engaged and communal hub for education to a mostly deserted campus with many students left asking, where to go now?

Thankfully, the school made the correct choice, as the University township, Storm Lake, would become one of the most concentrated areas in the US for COVID-19 exposure. 

Many from the community were left asking,
>
Am I sick?
>
Is a person close to me sick?
>
Will I give it to somebody at high risk?
>

These questions can begin to occupy our minds, taking away from focus on our passions and obligations. The silver-lining to these widespread feelings is is the new insight we can obtain from how anxiety, panic, and fear all play an integral role on our attitude. Naturally, anything that threatens you or a loved ones survival will emit an emotional response, and this is good!

However, when these thoughts shift to worrying about matters outside our control it can begin to fog our goals. For entrepeneurs and professionals it is important to keep moving forward, finding creative ways to move through the obstacles we now face. As emotional creatures, it becomes very exhausting to try and *control* your emotions; rather, we should seek insight from the emotions we feel. By doing this, we can psychologically abstract our ego from the circumstance and respond more effectively as leaders. There is much uncertainty in the future of this epidemic, but by understainding the anxieties we now face, we can more clearly see the objective and begin finding solutions.

This model of thinking can be applied to our lives in many ways. Maybe you are late for a deadline, are frustrated someone else did not fulfill what they said they would, or weeks of planning just didn't work out this time. Regardless, we can choose how we will handle our emotions to be a positive force in our daily activities.

Recognizing our own emotions as a powerful force that we are willing to understand can help us become better peers, and motivate innovation. At Levity, we built this company during an epidemic and economic collapse. Despite these odds, we rallied and created an even stronger team. Levity continues to build on its remote service, and will continue to help companies invest in their digital services during these challenges, and long-after.
